The **WebQuiz** administrative interface allows you to manage quizzes, view results, approve user requests, and work with files directly through the browser.
Access to the panel opens automatically if you connect from a local address (`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`), or using a **Master Key** if connecting from another device on the network.
